    <p>Writing intros is weird. Am I supposed to tell you I like cats or something
       like that? Anyway, if you've found this page you're probably a cool tech
       potato. Feel free to stick around and click around!
       If you're not, then I'm not sure how you found this page :I, BUT IT'S OK!
       I won't discriminate against your sick hobbies unless, of course,
       you hate waffles in which case you should probably show yourself out because
       only crazy people don't like waffles pfft. This is probably one of the most
       uninformative intros ever - seriously at this point you're probably thinking
       "wtf is even happening?" - but that's ok because all you have to know is
       that I'm Erica, and again, hey, it's nice to meet you.

       Also, go ahead, <i>click that background</i>,
       and if anyone's asking it's not dicking around under the guise
       of profiling. (But between you and me, <i>it totally is</i> ^^)
